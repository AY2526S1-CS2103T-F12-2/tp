## Overview
**ClassConnect** is a desktop app for **private tutors managing 20â€“40 students**.
It streamlines the tracking of student profiles â€” including **contacts, tuition timings, homework deadlines, exam dates, payments, and performance notes** â€” all in a simple **command-line interface (CLI)**.

Unlike tuition-center management systems, ClassConnect is built for **speed, simplicity, and solo use**. Tutors can manage lessons and admin tasks efficiently without bloated dashboards.
